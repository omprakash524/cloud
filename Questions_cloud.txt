Q1.Suppose you are the member of a project team and working on a very important project using Virtual machine based on windows OS (Say A). Now you need to work with one more VM (Say B) having same features as of windows based VM (A). Which efficient and time saving mechanism will you apply?
.
One efficient and time-saving mechanism to work with another Virtual Machine (VM) having the same features as your current VM is to create a clone of your existing VM (A) and then make the necessary modifications to create the new VM (B).

To create a clone of VM (A), you can use the "Clone" feature of your virtualization software, such as VMware or VirtualBox. This feature creates an exact copy of VM (A) with all its settings, configurations, and installed software. You can then rename the clone as VM (B) and make any necessary changes, such as changing the hostname, IP address, or adding new software.

This approach saves time because you don't have to manually install and configure the new VM (B) from scratch. You can use the existing VM (A) as a template and modify it as required. Additionally, since both VMs have the same features, you can easily transfer files and settings between them, making your workflow smoother and more efficient.

Finally, you can also consider using automation tools such as Ansible or Puppet to automate the configuration of the new VM (B) based on the settings of VM (A), further reducing the time and effort required.

Q2.Show the sharing of notepad document from Virtual machine ABC windows guest OS with the Host machine.

To share a notepad document from a Windows guest OS running in a virtual machine (ABC) with the host machine, you can follow the steps below:
.
Start the virtual machine and log in to the Windows guest OS.

Open the Notepad document you want to share.

Click on "File" in the Notepad menu bar, and then click "Save As".

In the "Save As" dialog box, navigate to a shared folder that can be accessed by both the guest and host OS. For example, you can create a new folder on the desktop and name it "SharedFolder".

Click on the "Save" button to save the document to the shared folder.

On the virtualization software's menu bar, click on "Devices" and then click "Insert Guest Additions CD image". This will mount the guest additions CD image as a virtual CD on the guest OS.

In the guest OS, open the "My Computer" or "This PC" window and navigate to the mounted CD drive.

Double-click on the "VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe" file to run the VirtualBox Guest Additions installer.

Follow the prompts in the installer to install the Guest Additions.

After the Guest Additions are installed, restart the virtual machine.

Once the virtual machine has restarted, open the shared folder on the host OS to access the Notepad document that was saved in the shared folder.

You can now edit or view the Notepad document on the host OS.

Note: The exact steps may differ slightly depending on the virtualization software being used, but the general steps should be similar.
